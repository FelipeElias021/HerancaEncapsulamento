The first will calculate the employee's pay and the outsource employee, using the basic concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, add a new employee and calculate his pay, the same with outsourcing, but will add an extra pay

The second (Tax Payment) will also use abstract methods. The subclass will override the methods of superclass, and these methods and classes are sealed. The program will calculate the tax payments of companies and people.
